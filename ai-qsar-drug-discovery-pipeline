AI-Driven QSAR & Virtual Screening Pipeline for Anti-Cancer Scaffold Discovery
📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end computational drug discovery pipeline integrating:

Cheminformatics (RDKit)

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

Model Interpretability (SHAP)

Molecular Docking (AutoDock Vina)

The pipeline predicts compound activity (IC₅₀), toxicity, and drug-likeness, and integrates docking scores to prioritize anti-cancer scaffolds targeting Caspase-9, BCL-2, and VEGF.

⚙️ Workflow

2048-bit Morgan fingerprint generation (radius=2)

Regression modeling (IC₅₀ prediction)

Toxicity classification with SMOTE balancing

Deep learning regression (LogP prediction)

SHAP-based model interpretability

Docking score integration & consensus scoring
